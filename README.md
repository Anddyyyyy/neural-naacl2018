# neural-naacl2018
This repository contains neural models and instructions on how to reproduce our results for our neural grammatical error correction systems from M. Junczys-Dowmunt, R. Grundkiewicz, S. Guha, K. Heafield: Approaching Neural Grammatical Error Correction as a Low-Resource Machine Translation Task, NAACL 2018.

This is under construction and should contain useful information around the time of NAACL 2018 in June. Possibly earlier.
